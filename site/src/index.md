# Overview

!!! note

    This mini-site is meant to accompany the paper:

    T. L. Nagy, J. Strickland, O. D. Weiner, *Elife* **2023**, 
    [DOI 10.7554/elife.90551.](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/90551)

The goal is facilitate reproducible and reusable research by publishing the code
and data such that the analysis is built using continuous integration to make
sure that the code is valid, functional, and robust to future updates. The
[Figures](@ref) page has the separate Jupyter notebooks used to make the figures
in the paper.

This site would not be possible without the fantastic
[`Documenter.jl`](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/), 
[`Literate.jl`](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl), and
[`DemoCards.jl`](https://democards.juliadocs.org/stable/) libraries.
